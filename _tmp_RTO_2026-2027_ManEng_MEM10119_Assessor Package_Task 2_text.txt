Ensure this page is printed and accessible to guide assessment processes
As the assessor/teacher, it is your responsibility to clearly communicate all aspects of the assessment process to students and ensure they are absolutely prepared. 
Do not instruct a student on how to answer a question or complete a task. 
Use the benchmark responses to guide marking and ensure consistency. Keep benchmarks secure and never show or share with students.
Before the Assessment:
Inform students of key details.
date, time, and location of the assessment
what to bring (e.g. identification, materials, tools)
dress requirements (e.g. specific attire, PPE/safety gear)
Confirm readiness:
Ensure students have received all teaching and learning of the unit content. 
Ensure students have had time to practise related skills before the assessment. 
Support needs:
Discuss any reasonable adjustments with students in advance.
Encourage disclosure of additional learner support needs early so appropriate adjustments can be arranged.
During the Assessment: 
Oversee the evidence gathering process to ensure it remains valid, sufficient, authentic, current and flexible.
You may ask students questions to ensure all assessment requirements are addressed.
Ensure the student completes activities at a pace consistent with commercial speed, timing, and productivity expectations.
After the Assessment: 
Feedback:
Provide students with timely, meaningful feedback by promptly marking tasks and returning within 2 weeks of the submission date, giving clear written comments, and offering verbal feedback where appropriate.
Refer to the assessment criteria to highlight strengths and areas for improvement.
Document feedback on EC or hardcopy version of the assessment.
Recording results:
Each assessment component must be marked Satisfactory (S) or Not Yet Satisfactory (NYS).
The unit of competency will be reported as Achieved only when all components are marked Satisfactory.
Evidence collection:
Upload all evidence to EC, including any Not Yet Satisfactory attempts.

Order and prepare the required resources, equipment and storage area
Before starting, explain the task and expectations to the student, and allow time for questions.
During the assessment:
Refer to your printed copy general instructions Conducting and Managing Assessments.
Observe the student completing each task.
Use the observation checklist to assess their performance against each criterion.
You may answer general or procedural questions, but do not help with completing tasks. 
Record all observations in the assessment tool, including strengths, areas for improvement, and any deviations from standard practice. Ensure your notes align with the criteria.
After the assessment:
Refer to your printed copy general instructions Conducting and Managing Assessments. 
If a particular skill is not observed, note on the checklist and discuss with student when and how this evidence will be collected.
