Do not instruct a student on how to answer a question or complete a task. Use the benchmark responses to guide marking and ensure consistency. Keep benchmarks secure and never show or share with students.Before the Assessment:Inform students of key details.date, time, and location of the assessmentwhat to bring (e.g. identification, materials, tools)dress requirements (e.g. specific attire, PPE/safety gear)Confirm readiness:Ensure students have received all teaching and learning of the unit content. Ensure students have had time to practise related skills before the assessment. Support needs:Discuss any reasonable adjustments with students in advance.Encourage disclosure of additional learner support needs early so appropriate adjustments can be arranged.During the Assessment: Oversee the evidence gathering process to ensure it remains valid, sufficient, authentic, current and flexible.You may ask students questions to ensure all assessment requirements are addressed.Ensure the student completes activities at a pace consistent with commercial speed, timing, and productivity expectations.After the Assessment: Feedback:Provide students with timely, meaningful feedback by promptly marking tasks and returning within 2 weeks of the submission date, giving clear written comments, and offering verbal feedback where appropriate.Refer to the assessment criteria to highlight strengths and areas for improvement.Document feedback on EC or hardcopy version of the assessment.Recording results:Each assessment component must be marked Satisfactory (S) or Not Yet Satisfactory (NYS).The unit of competency will be reported as Achieved only when all components are marked Satisfactory.Evidence collection:Upload all evidence to EC, including any Not Yet Satisfactory attempts.Section 1 â€“ QuestioningAssessor InstructionsRefer to General instructions Managing and Conducting Assessments above.

Olivia has been operating the angle grinder in Area A for the last hour and has become careless. At 10am, while cutting some rectangular hollow sections (RHS), her hand comes in contact with the unguarded blade, resulting in a severe cut to the top of her right thumb.Â Olivia is conscious but is pale and bleeding heavily.Â  She sits down and leans against a wall. Dean gives Olivia a sterile pad from the first aid kit to put over the thumb for her to apply pressure to stop the bleeding and wraps her in a blanket to reduce the effects of shock. Dean gets you to call 000 for an ambulance. She is transported to Lancer Hospital for further treatment.Â Dean then reports to the Principal Contractor (Bob Hughes), who provides him the below Incident and Injury Report to compile.Incident ReportDetails of injury (eg to a worker or visitor) and treatmentÂ Date of incidentÂ Â 29/01/24Â Time of incidentÂ 10Â amÂ pmÂ Nature of incidentÂ Near missÂ First aidÂ Medical treatment/doctorÂ Name of injured personÂ Olivia RobertsÂ AddressÂ 123 Bondi St, LancerÂ OccupationÂ LabourerÂ Date of birthÂ 20/06/91Â TelephoneÂ 555 1800Â EmployerÂ Metal ManufacturingÂ CompanyActivity in which the person was engaged at the time of injuryÂ Using an angle grinder to cut RHSÂ Exact site location where injury occurredÂ Area ANature of injury â€“ eg fracture, burn, sprain, foreign body in eyeÂ Severe cut to right thumbÂ Â Body location of injury (indicate location of injury on the diagram)Â 353250572453500101790572453500Â Treatment given on siteÂ Sterile pad applied to cutName of treating personÂ Dean JohnsonÂ Referral for further treatment?Â Â Yes / NoÂ Lancer HospitalÂ SafeWork NSW medical certificate received?Â Yes / NoÂ UnsureÂ Â Witness to incident (each witness may need to provide an account of what happened)Â Witness nameÂ Dean JohnsonÂ Witness contactÂ 555 1800Â Witness nameÂ Student completing inserts their nameÂ Witness contactÂ 555 1800Â Â Details of incident (eg property, plant or environmental damage)Â Details of damage to equipment or propertyÂ NoÂ Name of person who received the reportÂ Bob HughesÂ TelephoneÂ 555 1800Â Â Description of incidentÂ Olivia was using the angle grinder in Area A to cut RHS.Her hand came in contact with an unguarded blade, resulting in a severe cut to the top of her right thumb.Â Â Immediate response actions (eg barricades, isolation of power) to stabilise the situationÂ Dean applied a sterile pad to the cut and I called the ambulance.Â Â Reported toÂ Reported to principal contractor?
