The code of conduct requires worker to do this
You have been asked to measure and conduct various tasks on a round steel pipe with the following dimensions – internal diameter = 150mm and length = 10m. Use this scenario to answer Question 2 to 3.
Calculate the internal circumference (in mm) of the round steel pipe. (Use 3.14 for Pi)
Diameter x Pi. (150 x 3.14 )= 471mm

Calculate the volume (in ) of the round steel pipe (to 2 decimal places). (Use 3.14 for Pi)
Pi xx 10 (3.14 x x10) = 0.18 

You have been asked to conduct various tasks on a shipping container with the following dimensions – length = 10m, width = 5m and height = 4m. Use this scenario to answer Question 4 to 7.
Calculate the total length (in metres) of steel angle required to cover all external edges of the shipping container.
Length x 4 + width x 4 + height x 4 (10 x 4 + 5 x 4 + 4 x 4) = 76m

Calculate the total (in)of Colourbond sheeting required to line all sides of the shipping container.
Length x width x 2 + length x height x 2 + width x height x 2 (10 x 5 x 2 + 10 x 5 x 2 + 5 x 4 x 2) = 220 

Calculate the total volume (in ) of the shipping container.
Length x width x height (10 x 5 x 4) = 200 

What percentage of the shipping container would be filled if 100 of material is in it?
Filled material ÷ total volume x 100 (100 ÷ 200 x 100) = 50%

A metal fabricator must cut a section of 5.22m RHS into 5 even parts. Use this scenario to answer Question 8 to 9.

Rounding to 2 decimal places, what is the length of each part?
Total length ÷ 5 (5.22 ÷ 5) = 1.04m
