Students also receive individual guidance to assess the suitability of the course for their goals and abilities. 
Student Enrolment
The RTO’s Vocational Education and Training (VET) enrolment process includes an induction presentation, language, literacy, and numeracy assessment and the collection of a student’s USI.
Modes of Delivery
The course utilises a blended learning approach, combining face-to-face instruction, learning modules and practical sessions. This multimodal delivery allows learners to engage with materials in different formats, accommodating diverse learning styles and enhancing skill development. Technologies such as the Learner Management System (LMS), virtual simulations, and interactive activities play a key role in the delivery.
Course Structure and Pace of Training
Volume of Learning
The Australian Qualifications Framework (AQF) specifies a Volume of Learning of 600-1200 hours for a Certificate I qualification. For this course, the Volume of Learning is set at 712 hours, incorporating both structured training and additional school-based and independent learning.
Factors informing the volume of learning
Prior learning and general capabilities – Students bring skills developed through NSW Education Standards Authority (NESA) syllabuses (English, Mathematics, Science, HSIE), strengthening literacy, numeracy, problem solving, and teamwork. Many also study Metal Technology and Manufacturing Pathways in Years 7–10, providing foundational knowledge in tool use, project preparation, and safe work practices.
Amount of training – 240 hours of face-to-face delivery over two (2) years, delivered through timetabled classes, clustered assessment tasks, and practical activities.
Self-directed and complementary learning – Students are expected to dedicate 2–4 hours per week to homework, revision, online modules, or workplace-related activities. NESA mandated content reinforces and extends VET course knowledge.
Workplace learning and enrichment – Students engage in work placement, work readiness programs (e.g., Go2workplacement), excursions, and in some cases entrepreneurial work experience or extracurricular activities strengthening employability skills.
Pacing and Progression
Training is sequenced to allow sufficient opportunity for instruction, practice, feedback, and assessment. Delivery ensures learners can meet competency requirements within the allocated timeframe and with appropriate support.
Assessment Structure
Similar or complementary units of competency are clustered to reflect workplace practices and promote holistic, industry-relevant learning. This clustering ensures students develop an integrated understanding of the workplace while avoiding duplication of assessment. As a result, the 13 units of competency are assessed through six clustered assessment tasks, reducing repetition and streamlining the overall assessment process.
Weekly timetabling ensures regular, ongoing training. Skills and knowledge are consolidated both in and out of timetabled classes as resources are available on site and on-line. Feedback from the trainer is always available and accessible during the school year. 
Work Placement
All students’ complete mandatory work placement through a structured program managed by contracted workplace learning providers. These providers collaborate with local industry to ensure placements:
Align with qualification requirements
Provide authentic, quality learning experience
Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) and Credit transfer (CT)
Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL)
Students may apply for Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL). RPL is conducted as an assessment process and requires students to provide evidence demonstrating competence against the unit(s) of competency. Evidence may include 
workplace documents, portfolios, third-party reports, or practical demonstrations.
The RTO ensures RPL assessments meet the Principles of Assessment and Rules of Evidence.
A qualified assessor reviews all submissions and may require students to participate in a competency conversation, a challenge task or skills demonstration to confirm competence.
All RPL decisions and supporting evidence are documented and securely stored in the RTO’s LMS. 
Credit Transfer (CT)
Credit Transfer is granted where a student provides evidence of prior completion of the same or an equivalent unit of competency. Evidence must be in the form of:
AQF certification documentation (qualification, statement of attainment, or record of results), or
an authenticated VET transcript issued by the USI Registry.
All documentation is verified for authenticity prior to granting CT.
CT decisions are recorded in the LMS and reported in Schools Online.
Evidence is stored securely in accordance with RTO recordkeeping requirements.
Facilities, Resources and Equipment
The RTO ensures all students have access to the facilities, equipment and resources required by the Training Package (units of competency) for the delivery and assessment of MEM10119 Certificate I in Engineering (2) & Statement of Attainment towards MEM20422 Certificate II in Engineering Pathways (1). 
Facilities and equipment
All delivery sites meet the requirements outlined in the Course Information Guide, (accessed from the document library) which details the facilities, equipment, and resources required for course delivery and assessment. Site Managers (Principals) are responsible for ensuring all required facilities and equipment are in place before approval to deliver is granted.
Learning and assessment materials
Training and assessment resources, including learner guides, assessment tools, and mapping documentation, are provided by the RTO through the Learner Management System (LMS) and Document Management System. All resources are version-controlled to ensure consistency and compliance across delivery sites. Trainers and assessors have access to supplementary resources, such as industry websites, workplace templates, and multimedia learning tools, to support student learning.
Curriculum and compliance resources
NESA syllabus documents and support packages are used alongside RTO resources to ensure alignment with senior secondary requirements.
Quality assurance
All training resources are mapped to the requirements of the Training Package and relevant units of competency.
The RTO reviews training techniques, activities, and resources annually to confirm they:
Engage students and support learning progression
Reflect current industry practices
Provide a balance of theoretical knowledge and practical skill development
Evidence of engagement and effectiveness is gathered through student feedback, completion data, validation sessions, and professional development undertaken by trainers and assessors.
Assessment 
Methods of Assessment
Specific evidence gathering techniques for each unit of competency is detailed in the course assessment plan. Assessment is conducted at appropriate points in the course, ensuring learners have had sufficient practice and preparation before being assessed.
Questioning:
written or oral related to knowledge eg quizzes or interviews
Product based:
structured activities eg role plays, presentations and reports 
Direct observation:
observations of practical skills during real time simulated or work environment
Work placement Logs and reports:
logbook maintained during mandatory work placements, detailing activities and reflections.
Assessment is designed to comply with the Principles of Assessment (validity, reliability, flexibility, and fairness) and the Rules of Evidence (valid, sufficient, authentic, current). Tools are systematically reviewed prior to use to confirm they meet training product requirements. Feedback is provided promptly to support learner progression.
Learner Support and Reasonable Adjustments
Learner needs are reviewed regularly throughout the course, and additional support or adjustments will be provided where required ensuring each student is given the opportunity to successfully engage with the course. Where a learner requires additional support, this is documented and monitored throughout training.
NESA provides guidance on supporting students with additional needs in VET courses. Specific information and examples of adjustments are available in the VET courses and students with disability resources. Disability Standards and Guidelines.
Trainers are provided with evidence of a student’s support requirements, such as a Learning and Support Plan (LSP), Personalised Learning Plan (ILP/PLP), or other documentation. Adjustments may include:
accessible classrooms,
extended time for training or assessment,
additional support in the classroom or workplace
note-taking assistance 
course material in alternate formats (electronic, large print, braille
use of assistive technology, 
extra time or extensions for homework and assessments
modified assessment tasks for accessibility,
an Auslan interpreter or other tailored support.
 Other adjustments as required
Reasonable adjustments are applied to delivery and assessment strategies where required, provided they remain consistent with the competency standards outlined in the Training Package and comply with the Disability Standards for Education.
Differentiation
Differentiation strategies are applied for all students, including those without a formal diagnosis, to address varying levels of readiness, interests, and learning styles. Trainers may modify content, processes, products, or the learning environment to ensure equitable access to learning opportunities. Strategies for Differentiation
Recording and Evidence
Trainers must ensure they have access to any relevant student support documentation (e.g., ILP, LSP, or PLP) and apply reasonable adjustments as required. Evidence of adjustments and support strategies must be recorded in individual student files and/or class records, not in the TAS.
Note: Systematic monitoring of learner progress and formal intervention processes are detailed separately in the section Monitoring Learner Progress and Interventions. 
Monitoring Learner Progress and Interventions
Learner progress is monitored through:
Attendance and participation records – regular tracking of face-to-face classes, online learning activities, and work placement engagement.
Formative assessments – quizzes, practice activities, and trainer observations used to confirm readiness before formal assessment. 
Learner Management System (LMS) data - monitoring of student access, task completion, and engagement with online materials. 
Trainer observations and feedback – trainers provide continuous feedback and record progress against competency requirements.
Intervention Strategies
Where a learner is identified as being at risk of not meeting course requirements, the following targeted interventions may be implemented:
one-on-one support or mentoring,
catch-up sessions or supplementary tutorials,
scaffolded or adjusted learning activities,
provision of additional learning resources,
closer supervision during practical tasks, or
negotiated extensions or adjusted timelines (in line with the Principles of Assessment and reasonable adjustment requirements).
SBATS
SBAT work requirements 
Students enrolled in the MEM10119 Certificate I in Engineering (2) & Statement of Attainment towards MEM20422 Certificate II in Engineering Pathways (1) as part of a School Based Apprenticeship or Traineeship (SBAT) are required to complete a minimum of 100 days (7 hours per day) of paid workplace learning. This provides them practical experience, allowing them to apply course knowledge in a real-world environment.
Is there a School Based Trainee in this cohort?
 NO  YES
Teacher to follow appropriate SBAT procedure.
Trainer and Assessor Competency
The NSW Department of Education ensures trainers and assessors must:
hold the TAE40122, or TAE40116 Certificate IV in Training Assessment or the TAESS00019 Assessor Skill Set.
demonstrate vocational competency at least to the level being delivered and assessed, and
maintain current skills and knowledge in both vocational content and training/assessment practice.
If a trainer is not fully accredited in training and assessment, the RTO will implement a Supervised Delivery Plan (SDP) detailing arrangements and identifying a mentor who is an accredited trainer and assessor to provide interim support.
The Authority to Deliver (ATD) for each site, developed by the RTO and acknowledged by the Site Manager (Principal) or their delegate ensures trainers have current industry skills and knowledge relevant to the training product and provides authorisation for them to deliver qualifications within the scope of registration.
Industry Currency
The RTO ensures trainers and assessors maintain industry currency through engagement with current industry practices. This may include workplace experience, consulting, professional networks, industry projects, or participation in industry events. Evidence of currency is documented and reviewed regularly to confirm alignment with the training product being delivered.
Professional Development
The RTO supports trainers and assessors to participate in ongoing professional development to maintain and extend their VET knowledge and practice. Activities may include internal and external training, participation in moderation and validation processes, mentoring, or engagement in professional learning communities.
Monitoring and Records
Each trainer maintains a professional profile recording qualifications, vocational competency, industry currency activities, and professional development. These records are verified by the RTO and reviewed annually to ensure trainers remain fully compliant and current.
Validation Plan
A systematic approach to the review and validation of assessment tools is implemented. NSW Department of Education has developed a support document and checklist to facilitate this process. Stakeholders involved in the assessment validation process include RTO management staff, supervisors, trainers and where possible, industry representatives.
Industry Engagement
This TAS has been created through a collaborative process involving Curriculum Development Team (CDT), the Industry Training Advisory Body (ITAB) and experienced and qualified trainers. Information is gathered from a variety of sources to report on strategies, practices and industry skills of trainers. This occurs:
in the development of the syllabus from the training package. NESA have considerable consultation with industry bodies and trainers
when trainers consult with employers before, during and/or at the completion of work placement 
as part of the validation process when industry representatives provide advice on the quality of delivery and assessment strategies
when feedback is obtained from employer surveys.
